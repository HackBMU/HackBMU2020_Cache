## VisionTrack
### Inspiration:
-> Those who are physically confined or paralyzed and who cannot effectively communicate through body language or verbal language can also make use of the advancing technology.

-> We wanted to make a web app implementing eye movement based tracking and health management to help the deprived and paralyzed one to communicate with others.

### Our Solution: VisionTrack
-> This project is a paralyzed assistive eye based technology. It features our windowsâ€™ application and python  scripts that uses a webcam and the web browser to allow interactions through only eye movement that controls the movement of the cursor.

### What it Does?
-> The website will allow the user to communicate their needs and feelings to people nearby as it can be linked directly to a nurse or medical personnel's contact information (i.e. computer, phone, or pager) as well as contact people outside of the hospital such as friends and family through an SMS server.

-> By using eye tracking as provided by our open source platform, we were able to remap the data feed to control ones cursor to interact with the website. 

-> If after a car crash one was confined to the bed and could not talk with ease, they can easily use their eyes to select predefined options such as "Request a shower, Assistance with the toilet, Request a drink, Request Food, etc." It makes communicating discomfort much easier and probing the patient more simple without the need of the nurse to constantly ask questions.
